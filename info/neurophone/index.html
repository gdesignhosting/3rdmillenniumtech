					<p>This amazing piece of technology was developed by Patrick Flanagan when he was 14 years old in 1958!</p>

					<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
					
					<p>The skin is our largest and most complex organ. In addition to being the first line of defense against infection, the skin is a gigantic liquid crystal brain.</p> 
					
					<p>The skin is piezoelectric. When it is vibrated or rubbed, it generates electric signals and scalar waves. Every organ of perception evolved from the skin. When we are embryos, our sensory organs evolved from folds in the skin. Many primitive organisms and animals can see and hear with their skin.</p>
					
					<p>When the Neurophone was originally developed, neurophysiologists considered that the brain was hard-wired and that the various cranial nerves were hard-wired to every sensory system. The eighth cranial nerve is the nerve bundle that runs from the inner ear to the brain. Theoretically, we should only be able to hear with our ears if our sensor organs are hard-wired. Now the concept of a holographic brain has come into being.</p>
					
					<p>The holographic brain theory states that the brain uses a holographic encoding system so that the entire brain may be able to function as a multiple-faceted sensory encoding computer. This means that sensory impressions may be encoded so that any part of the brain can recognize input signals according to a special encoding. Theoretically, we should be able to see and hear through multiple channels.</p> 
					
					<p>The key to the Neurophone is the stimulation of the nerves of the skin with a digitally encoded signal that carries the same time-ratio encoding that is recognized as sound by any nerve in the body.</p>
					
					<p>All commercial digital speech recognition circuitry is based on so-called dominant frequency power analysis. While speech can be recognized by such a circuit, the truth is that speech encoding is based on time ratios. If the frequency power analysis circuits are not phased properly, they will not work. The intelligence is carried by phase information. The frequency con-tent of the voice gives our voice a certain quality, but frequency does not contain information. All attempts at computer voice recognition and voice generation are only partially successful. Until digital time-ratio encoding is used, our computers will never be able to really talk to us.</p>

					<p>The computer that we developed to recognize speech for the man-dolphin communicator used time-ratio analysis only. By recognizing and using time-ratio encoding, we could transmit clear voice data through extremely narrow bandwidths. In one device, we developed a radio transmitter that had a bandwidth of only 300 Hz while maintaining crystal clear transmission. Since signal-to-noise ratio is based on band width considerations, we were able to transmit clear voice over thousands of miles while using milliwatt power.</p>

					<p>Improved signal-processing algorithms are the basis of a new series of Neurophones that are currently under development.</p>

					<p>These new Neurophones use state-of-the-art digital processing to render sound information much more accurately.</p>

					<hr>

					<p>13-year-old Flanagan became inspired to invent the Neurophone by a 1911 Hugo Gernsback science fiction tale about a sleep learning tool. Decades later, Patrick's Neurophone impressed Hugo (for whom the prestigious Hugo Nebula Awards are named) deeply enough to extend a personal thank you to Dr. Flanangan for carrying out one of Gernsback's visions of the future, which included the prediction of television.</p>
